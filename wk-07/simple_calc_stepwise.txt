# PROJECT: (WK-07) A Simple Calculator - Pseudo Code
# Solution written by Darren Halpin

# write intro info
    write "simple calculator"
    write "input 2 integers and an operator"

# get user input
    read "integer 1: "
    read "integer 2: "
    read "operator ( - + * / )"

# check operator input and output result
    if input operator is plus
        sum = integer 1 plus integer 2
        write "integer 1 plus integer 2 = sum"

    else if input operator is minus
        sum = integer 1 minus integer 2
        write "integer 1 minus integer 2 = sum"

    else if input operator is asterisk
        sum = integer 1 multiplied by integer 2
        write "integer 1 multiplied by integer 2 = sum"

    else if input operator is forward slash
        sum = integer 1 divided by integer 2
        write "integer 1 divided by integer 2 = sum"

    else
        write "Invalid operator selected"
