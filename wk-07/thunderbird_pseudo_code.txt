        write "Thunderbird 1 pilot is Scott Tracy"
    else if user input == 2
        write "Thunderbird 1 pilot is Scott Tracy"
    else if user input == 3
        write "Thunderbird 1 pilot is Scott Tracy"
    else if user input == 4
        write "Thunderbird 1 pilot is Scott Tracy"
    else if user input is anything else
